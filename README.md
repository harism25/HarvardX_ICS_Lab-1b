A small program that first prompts the user to type in a starting population number.

If the user enters an input of less than 9 (the mininmum allowed population size),
the user should be re-prompted to enter a starting population size until they enter a number that is either 9 or bigger than 9.
The program then prompts the user for an ending population size..

If the user enters a number less than the starting population size,
the user is re-prompted to enter an ending population size until they enter a number that is '>' or '=' to the starting size.
The program then calculates the number of years required for the population to reach at least the size of the end value,
and then prints that number, as by printing to the terminal Years: n, where n is the number of years.
